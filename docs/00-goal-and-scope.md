# Goal and Scope

The purpose of this project is to **repurpose a Sony VAIO PCG-7142L (Vista-era)**
into a dedicated development station for STACKSWORTH firmware.

## Scope
- Install a modern lightweight Linux distro (Lubuntu or Mint XFCE)
- Add Arduino IDE and PlatformIO
- Connect GitHub for repo commits
- Optional: upgrade RAM (DDR2) and replace HDD with SSD
- Document every step slowly and clearly so others can follow

## Rules
1. One small step at a time
2. No guessing — always document facts
3. Don’t change more than one variable at once
4. Stop on success, don’t rush
5. Keep repo as the **single source of truth**
