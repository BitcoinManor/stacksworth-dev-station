# STACKSWORTH Dev Station â€“ VAIO Revival

This repo documents the journey of turning an old **Sony VAIO PCG-7142L (Vista-era)**
into a dedicated Linux development workstation for **Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, and GitHub**
to power STACKSWORTH firmware projects.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Reuse legacy hardware instead of discarding it
- Create a stable, distraction-free Arduino/PlatformIO IDE station
- Keep a full step-by-step record for others to replicate
- Earn those sweet ðŸŸ© green squares while weâ€™re at it

## ðŸ“– Docs
- `docs/00-goal-and-scope.md` â†’ high-level project mission
- `docs/01-model-and-specs.md` â†’ VAIO model details, baseline specs, discovery logs

## âœ… Status
- [ ] Repo initialized
- [ ] Baseline specs captured
- [ ] Linux distro chosen
- [ ] Live USB tested
- [ ] Linux installed
- [ ] Arduino IDE + PlatformIO configured
- [ ] First successful Arduino upload
